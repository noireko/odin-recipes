    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flat base
      of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
      various other ingredients (such as anchovies, olives, meat, etc.), which
      is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
